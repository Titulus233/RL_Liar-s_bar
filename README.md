# Liar’s Deck Reinforcement Learning Agent

**Liar’s Deck** is a bluffing and social deduction game where the goal is to get rid of your cards while outsmarting and deceiving other players. This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to find the optimal strategy for **Liar’s Deck** using the `gymnasium` library and `Stable Baselines3`.
